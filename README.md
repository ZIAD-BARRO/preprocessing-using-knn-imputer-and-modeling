# 🧠 Handling Missing Data with KNN Imputer + Modeling

This project demonstrates how to preprocess data using **KNN Imputer** and build a machine learning model for classification/regression (based on your dataset). The project was originally developed on **Kaggle**.

---

## 📊 Project Summary

- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values using `KNNImputer` from scikit-learn.  
  - Scaled features for better model performance.  
  - Managed categorical variables (if any).

- **Modeling:**  
  - Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).  
  - Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
  - Tuned hyperparameters for better results.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

- `knn_preprocessing_modeling.ipynb`: Main notebook with preprocessing and model training steps.
- `data.csv`: (if applicable) Dataset used for the project.
- `README.md`: Project description.

## 📌 Notes

- KNN Imputer is useful when missing data is not random and can be estimated from nearby values.
- Scaling is important before applying KNN.
- Proper feature engineering can improve model accuracy.
